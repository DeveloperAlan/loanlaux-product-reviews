Product reviews are a core component of most e-commerce websites. Participating in building trust between merchants and visitors, they make for much higher conversion rates. When designed with Schema.org compatibility in mind, product review plugins also allow for better SEO. In fact, when Google's crawler bot detects a page containing an `AggregateRating` schema, it displays the rating value with stars under search results. Not only does this increase the website's PageRank, but it also simply convinces more visitors to choose your website over your competitors.

This plugin brings the power of product reviews to Reaction Commerce, with Schema.org compatibility built-in.
